I am a Master student at Xidian University which located in China，
I'm so sorry I all most haven't income that all my money is just enough to cover my living expense, so I don’t have extra money to register the class. Furthermore, I want to save money for my family Since my parents have been working so hard to support me.
For nowadays ，machine learning is so hot not only in China but also in the world
I request Coursera for financial aid, and I promise I will finish the course in time. I think Coursera is a very good platform for people to learn something they need, and sincerely hoping to learn something. This program provided by Coursera is a great opportunity for a poor student like me to pursue the course, and I hope I can get the chance. Thank you for your consideration. I hope you can agree with my application. I look forward to your reply.
Thank you so much
